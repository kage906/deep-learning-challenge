# Introduction
Welcome to my deep learning project! This project focuses on applying deep learning techniques to solve a specific problem. By leveraging neural networks and advanced machine learning algorithms, we aim to achieve accurate predictions using a real-world dataset. Using TensorFlow, Keras, and other essential libraries like pandas and scikit-learn, we build and train deep learning models. This repository contains code implementations, documentation, and analyses that showcase my deep learning skills and ability to tackle real-world challenges.

# Project Overview
The project aims to solve a classification problem using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the "Charity Data" dataset, which contains various features related to charitable organizations. The goal is to predict whether a charity organization will be successful or not based on the provided features.

# What I Did
In this project, I performed the following tasks:

Data preprocessing: I handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns, and performed feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
Feature engineering: I binned certain categorical features to reduce the number of unique values and improve model performance.
Model training and evaluation: I built a deep neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model was trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using a test dataset.
Model optimization: I experimented with different model architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and feature selection techniques to improve model accuracy.

# Tools Used
The project was implemented using the following tools and libraries:

Python: The programming language used for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
pandas: A powerful data manipulation library used for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
scikit-learn: A machine learning library used for splitting the data and performing feature scaling.
TensorFlow and Keras: Deep learning frameworks used for building and training the neural network model.
Google Colab: An interactive development environment based on Jupyter Notebook, used for exploratory data analysis and model development.

# What I Learned
Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience in several areas:

Data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and feature engineering.
Building and training deep neural network models using TensorFlow and Keras.
Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics and optimizing model accuracy.
Working with real-world datasets and applying machine learning techniques to solve classification problems.

# Conclusion
This project allowed me to apply my machine learning skills to solve a classification problem in the context of charity organizations. Through the tasks completed, I gained valuable insights into data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. I also enhanced my knowledge of using TensorFlow and Keras for building deep learning models. Overall, this project was a great learning experience and further solidified my understanding of machine learning concepts.

> ## Written Report 
The purpose of this analysis was to develop a deep learning model using neural networks to predict the success of Alphabet Soup grant applicants. By harnessing the power of machine learning, the model aims to identify applicants who are most likely to succeed in their businesses. This analysis includes data preprocessing, model compilation, training and evaluation.

> ## Data Preprocessing:
* To determine the success of an applicant when funded, the target variable used in the model is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column.
* The model's features include all columns except for those that are considered irrelevant and do not contribute to predicting the outcome.
* Variables such as "EIN" and "NAME" are identified as irrelevant and removed from the input data during the preprocessing stage.

> ## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* To enhance its predictive capabilities, the neural network model is outfitted with activation functions, layers, and a predetermined amount of neurons with the aim of capturing the data's intricate complexity.
* Based on experiment and consideration, the picking of activation functions, layers, and neuron count hinges on the complexity of the dataset.
* Depending on the dataset and issue at hand, the model's aim performance can fluctuate. It is crucial to establish the metrics for desired performance and compare the outcome with the model's output.
* Different steps can be taken to improve the model's performance such as experimenting with various activation functions or optimizers, optimizing hyperparameters, applying regularization techniques, increasing training data, and adjusting the model architecture.

> ## Summary
The deep learning model presents hopeful outcomes. It has the ability to pinpoint applicable features and targets, permitting precise predictions. Nonetheless, it is vital to mull over other models to resolve this classification problem. A gradient boosting machine (GBM), such as XGBoost or LightGBM, is a suggested model. GBMs excel in handling massive datasets, capturing the intricate connections between features, granting elucidation via feature importance analysis, and potentially offering more rapid training and improved performance on high-dimensional datasets. Expanding the search to GBMs as an alternative model could enhance the ability to predict for this classification problem.
